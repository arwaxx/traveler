        <p class="m2">Valley of the Kings, also known as "Valley of Biban of the Kings", is a valley in Egypt that was used for 500 years during the period between the sixteenth and eleventh centuries BC for the construction of tombs for the pharaohs and nobles of the modern state extending during the eighteenth to the twentieth dynasties in ancient Egypt. The valley on the west bank of the Nile, facing Thebes (currently Luxor), in the heart of the ancient funerary city of Thebes The Valley of the Kings is divided into two valleys; The eastern valley (where most of the royal tombs are located) and the western valley.
        </p>
        <p class="m2">With the discovery of the last burial chamber in 2006 known as (Tomb 63), in addition to the discovery of two other entrances to the same chamber during 2008, the number of tombs discovered so far has reached 63 cemeteries of varying sizes, ranging from a small pit in the ground to a complex cemetery containing more than 120 burial chamber inside. All these tombs were used to bury the kings and princes of the modern state in ancient Egypt, in addition to some nobles and those who were related to the ruling family at that time. The royal tombs are distinguished by their inscriptions and drawings from ancient Egyptian mythology illustrating the religious beliefs and memorial ceremonies of that time. And all the tombs discovered had been opened and looted in ancient times, and despite that remained irrefutable evidence of the strength and prosperity of the kings of that time.

              ‎Khan al-Khalil was not influenced by the factors of time, and remained inspired by writers and artists, and his achilles always instigated creativity, as Naguib Mahfouz wrote, his novel "Khan al-Khalili" inspired by the atmosphere of the old neighborhood, describing it as: "You will find in the long street, square buildings with side passages connecting the intersection of the original street, and the crowding of the sides of the corridors and the street itself with shops (i.e. shops); While there are cafés no larger than the size of a small shop, the manufacturers sat in front of the shops lying on their art patiently. ‎

            </p>
            <p class ="m1">And if the popular proverb says: “A man goes where he loves”, then the first bear on the land of the Khan must be in the Al-Fishawy Café, which is more than two hundred years old, and it is one of the oldest cafés in Cairo, and the great writer Naguib Mahfouz was one of the most famous pioneers in the period The sixties of the twentieth century
